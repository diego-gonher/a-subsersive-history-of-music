## Traditional ways of looking at Music History
Ted argues that traditionally, music history is taught in a decieving way. He argues that music institutions and the music community itself has created a sanitized version of how music came to be and how it has evolved, making it a respectful and prideful endevour.

However, music history is more convoluted than what is usually taught. Music has demonstrably been a catalyst and a force that has changed society in various forms. Music has been more than an artsitic endevour without any purpose beyond beauty itself.

Perhaps the most important pattern that gets repeated time and time again is the emergence of underground music, made by outcasts that defy the status quo. Ted says that the common cycle of mainstream music begins with some type of rebel musicians that create music that challenges the established music mainstream. Despite any attempts of supressing these outcasts, they, not infrequently, end up becoming part of mainstream music (think of the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan for recent examples).

With this in mind, Ted hopes to present music history with a more complete picture, trying his best to not ignore the "unsanitized" parts.

## How music came to be?
The origin of music is still very much deated, but some of the most compelling ideas include things like:

### Natural Soundscape
Some ecologists have noticed that the way wind interacts with different plants makes distinctive sounds (i.e. an oak tree sounds different from a sunflower). 

**Interestingly enough, I noticed this yesterday when I was walking in Saguaro, when the noise of the wind interacting with the plants sounded similar to cars approaching, or it made me think that there were maybe some animals**

Clearly, being able to extract important information from the soundscape that surrounds you could give you a survival advantage. 


### Love and Violence
The next two important concepts are love and violence. A myriad of surveys show how a lot of the most mainstream music involves either love (or sex more specifically) and violence. Drawing from ideas from Darwing and the theory of evolution, this shouldn't come as a major surprise.

Take birds for example. A lot of species use mating sounds, making tunes and rythmgs to attract potential partners to reproduce. But at the same time, some species use noise to mark their territory and intimidate.

Humans throughout history seem to allign with this as well.

In terms of sex, various surveys have shown that a vast majority of popular songs make reference to sex or love explicitly. Even songs found in religous texts, such as the bible, can be found to allign with this.

In terms of violence, a myriad of cultures have chants for war. Even the chants seen in sports can be seen as an example of music as a force of unity in a violent scenario.

**So, which one is it?**

Well, more recent studies have shown how singing in groups releases oxytocin, a hormone that makes us more likely to work in groups or pairs. Consequently, both sex and violence find support in this.

In other words, the biological foundations of music alling with a force of creative destruction.
